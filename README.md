## 1. How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

#### TypeScript enhances code quality by catching errors during development, before the code even runs. It ensures that values are used correctly, reducing bugs caused by incorrect data types or unexpected behavior.

#### For maintainability, TypeScript provides a clear structure with features like interfaces and static types. This makes code easier to read, understand, and update—especially in large projects or when working with teams. It also supports better tooling and editor support, which improves productivity and confidence when refactoring or expanding a codebase. Overall, TypeScript helps you write more reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications.



## 2. What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?

#### Type inference in TypeScript means the compiler can automatically determine the type of a variable or function result based on the value it’s assigned. You don’t always need to manually specify the type because TypeScript can often figure it out on its own.

#### This is helpful because it keeps your code clean and concise while still maintaining strong type safety. You get the benefits of fewer errors, improved auto-completion, and better developer experience without having to write extra type annotations everywhere. It strikes a balance between flexibility and safety, helping developers move faster while reducing the chances of bugs.
